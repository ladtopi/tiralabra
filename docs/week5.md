# Report for week 5

This week was a bit time scarce for me again, but I managed to polish the top
end of the app a bit. I split the actual functionality in a separate class, and
now the top level program really just facilitates the command line interface
using that class. I also completed the first peer review.

Next week will probably be spent mostly on documentation. The testing document
needs more beef, and I haven't yet started the user manual. Anyway, I think I'm
in a good place here.

Hours used: ~5h (course total 46h).
