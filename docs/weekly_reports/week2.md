# Report for week 2

This week I jumped in and started the implementation work. I seem to have a
working FFT implementation! Obviously some issues may be lurking. Since the
textbook definition of a discrete Fourier transform is rather simple, I decided
to implement a naive dft function as well directly from the definition. It's
easier to gain confidence that the simple function is working, and it can be
used to verify that the FFT function gives the correct output. I also plan to
later use it for performance testing.

I also started to work on the actual pitch detection. Currently the pitch
detection function works for a _very_ simple input, but work remains to be done here.

Overall, I think I'm in a pretty good position. Next week I will continue on the
pitch detection. I will also probably build a very simple command line interface
to the tuner.

Hours used: ~8h (course total 28h).
