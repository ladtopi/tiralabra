# Report for week 3

This was quite a busy week for me and I didn't have as much time to work on this
as I had hoped. I decided to ignore some of the nitty gritty details and focus
on getting something working end to end. This means that I now have a working
tuner application with a very simple CLI, and the tuner works, but is probably
not very reliable nor user friendly yet. The tuner only outputs raw frequencies
instead of note names, and will probably not work very well with signals rich in
harmonics. I seemed to get some pretty decent results though, from just humming
into the microphone.

Next week I will focus on improving the usability of the tuner, as well as take
another look at the pitch detection algorithm. I will also start to work on some
of the documentation.

Hours used: ~5h (course total 33h).
