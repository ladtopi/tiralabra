# Report for week 1

I decided to build a simple digital guitar tuner. I have very little prior
experience with signal processing, and felt like this was a opportunity to dive
in head first. I spent a lot of time this week just getting to grips with the
subject matter. I refreshed my memory on the physics of vibration and Fourier
transforms, and read a lot of material on pitch detection. I also spent quite
some time in a Jupyter notebook with numpy and matplotlib, trying to get a feel
for the algorithms and for how well the solution should (could) work if properly
implemented.

I think I have a really solid idea on how to proceed with the project, and will
start implementing the pitch detection components next week.

Hours used: ~20h (course total 20h).
